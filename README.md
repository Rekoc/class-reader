## Usage

### Basic Usage

After downloading, simply edit the HTML, CSS and Python files included with the template in your favorite text editor to make changes. These are the only files you need to worry about, you can ignore everything else! To preview the changes you make to the code, you need to follow this [Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/django-admin/) and open the localhost address in your web browser (should be 127.0.0.1:8000 by default).
